This is a proof of concept of a covert command and control channel implemented using TCP steganography.

Setup:

  1. create two ubuntu instances in vmware or docker
  2. copy server.py and steghelper.py to one instance as the "server"
  3. copy client.py and steghelper.py to the other instance as the "client"
  4. change the "dst" and "IFACE" gloabl variable in server.py to match the client's IP address and interface
  5. chnage the "dst" and "IFACE" global variable in client.py to macth the server's IP address and interface
  6. install and start apache on the server
  7. run server.py on the server
  8. run client.py and the client
